On this day, I want to give you something as a token of appreciation, and I thought it'd be nice if I could code something like you do :hendi: </span>

We have our misunderstandings, and fights, and there are also moments where it's difficult for us. Despite all, there's one thing I want you to know: I'm willing to work for us. I'm willing to make us work. Every day, it's a new day and we actively make choices in our life, and I choose to stay. I will stay for as long as you will have me.

I'm here with you because I want to be with you, and you're the person I want to be with. For all that you are. Remember when I told you that I want to love you so much that you start loving yourself? I hope one day, you could see it for yourself, all the sorts and bits of you that I love so much. I know to really love someone, means that you have to act on it, otherwise it's just words. So, through this website, I hope it shows. I love you.</span>
